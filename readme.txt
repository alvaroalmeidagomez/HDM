These files implement the Hodge Diffusion algorithm to extract topological properties from high-dimensional datasets.

We tested the algorithm on the 2D Torus and Sphere.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact: alvaroalmeidagomez182@gmail.com.

The algorithm was funded by the Centro de Modelamiento Matem√°tico (CMM) through the BASAL fund FB210005, a center of excellence from ANID-Chile.
